##jQuery Form Example
This is a form I created for an assignment

#HTML/Jquery Assignment Description

Create a web page with an html form where the user will be able to enter firstname, lastname, gender, address, city and state.
Note:  firstname, lastname, address and city are text fields. Gender is radio button group where the 2 choices are Male and Female. State is a drop down with choices of TN, TX, MS, AR and AL.

If the form is submitted without entering any value in firstname, lastname, address or city field, display alert window with validation error message.

When the form is initially loaded, neither Male or Female radio button will be selected. If the user does not choose any gender then alert window with validation error message.

Using JQuery, highlight the form elements when they are focused.
